These are very basic instructions to install p_group_cohomology

First of all, it is a SageMath package, thus, the SageMath software
needs to be installed. The easiest way to install the package is
  sage -i p_group_cohomology
but the purpose of this INSTALL instructions is to tell how that
works internally.

The SharedMeatAxe is a build-time dependency, thus, you need to install
it in SageMath, by
  sage -i meataxe

The following describes what happens internally if you do `sage -i p_group_cohomology`.
Open a Sage shell, i.e., run
  sage -sh

To install the sub-package modular_resolution, do
  cd present
  ./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --libdir="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"
  make
  make install
  cd ..

To install the sub-package pGroupCohomology, do
  cd src
  pip install . [--verbose]
  cd ..

To install the documentation of pGroupCohomology, do
  cd src/doc
  make html
and copy the resulting documentation from build/html to the desired
location.

A short test suite is available for modular_resolution and an extensive
test suite for pGroupCohomology. The former is executed by
  cd present
  make check
  cd ..
The latter is executed by
  cd src
  sage -t --force_lib pGroupChomology
  cd ..
